Assignments realized for course CSC_51051_EP

## TD1: Typing a simple programming language

- Definition of a toy functional language with basic arithmetic operations, if-else branching and pair manipulation.

- Formulation of type inference rules and implementation of type inference algorithms.

- Formulation of reduction rules and implmentation of reduction algorithms.

- (TODO) Addition of functions. This would require augmenting the current language with:

    - Hindley-Milner type inference algorithm and typing environment during type inference.
    
    - Program value, function closure and environment during reduction.
